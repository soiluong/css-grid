# CSS Grid
After 5 years of working on the specification for CSS Grid, major browsers
(but not IE and Edge fully...) have released support to use CSS Grid in March
2017. It will also gracefully fallback nicely to flexbox, inline-block and so
on. So why wait!?

## CSS Grid Example 1
In the first example of using CSS Grid I'll show you a quick demo of how a
common website layout might look with the use of `grid-area` and
`grid-template-areas` property.

It consists of a header, nav, main content, article, sidebar and footer on a
12 column layout.

It is also restricted to a width of 960px and centered on the page.

## CSS Grid Example 2
Same as Example 1 but the nav is embedded into the header and using more
properties that comes with CSS grid, which include `grid-column-start`,
`grid-column-end` and the `span` value.
